Flexpart conternization with simflex.  
To make Flexpart work you should install all required libraries and provide required inputs. This project is created to make it easy and isolated from your work environment.

## Flexpart

FLEXPART (“FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model”) is a Lagrangian transport and dispersion model suitable for the simulation of a large range of atmospheric transport processes. Apart from transport and turbulent diffusion, it is able to simulate dry and wet deposition, decay, linear chemistry; it can be used in forward or backward mode, with defined sources or in a domain-filling setting. It can be used from local to global scale.

## How parsing works

1. Creating COMMAND file for flexpart inputs

![Command file](/docs/command.png)

2. Creating OUTGRID file for flexpart inputs

![Outgrid file](/docs/outgrid.png)

3. Creating simflexinp.nml and measurem.csv for simflex inputs

![Simflexinp.nml file](/docs/simflexinp.png)

4. Creating RELEASES file for flexpart on each iteration

![Releases file](/docs/releases.png)

5. Creating or updating table_srs_paths.txt file for simflex on each iteration

![Table_srs_paths file](/docs/table_srs_paths.png)

## How to use

1. Build the image locally in the `dockerize-simflex` folder: `docker build -t simflex:v1 .`  
2. Prepare input data for the calculation. Create a folder `input` and puth there two files: `measurements.txt` and `options.xml`.  
3. Run the calculations by running container using created image and input data: `docker run -d -v --name=simflex "$PWD":/data/ simflex:v1`  
4. For connect to the running container use: `docker exec -it simflex /bin/bash`  
5. After calculations simflex ouput files will be located in `data/output/Nuclide-name`, this folders generated by simflex.  
6. Delete container, all data inside the container will be lost: `docker rm --volumes simflex`  

Description of the processes inside the container:
As an input data used two files: `measurements.txt` and `options.xml` that are located in the `/data/input/` folder. The main scrip `run.sh` will parse this files and create all required files for flexpart and simflex. After that, the calculation will start. The output data will be located in the `/data/output/`  and `/series/series_id/` folders. After the calculation is complete, the container will be stopped.
All process logs will be located in the `/data/calculations.log` file or you can use `docker logs -t container_id` command.

<br>

Copy grib file to docker container if you have them locally: `docker cp /path/grib.tar.gz container_id:/data/grib_data/`  
Interact with image without calculation (all chabgesa and data will be lost after you disconnect): `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash simflex:v1`  
Connect to the container without calculations(for example test purpose): `docker run -it --name simflex --entrypoint /bin/bash simflex:v1`
Copy files/folders from container to current local locations: `docker cp simflex:/data/calculation .`  
If calculation didn't complete successful use logs file to understand the problem: `docker logs -t simflex`  
All calculations also available on your machine(tested on Linux) because we copy all calculation to volume, but first you need to get volumes ID: `docker container inspect simflex | grep Source | awk -F\" '{print $4}'`
Simflex output files inside the container will be located in the `/data/output/Nuclide-name/`, use this value as a path to your folder with all information:  
![volumes name and folders](/docs/volume_location.png)
Delete image: `docker image rm simflex:v1`  
Delete all images that not used: `docker image prune -f`  
Increase performance by adding more cores and memory  
`docker inspect 345cb4176398 | grep Source` get the path where the input data is located  
`head ../input/measurements.txt | grep '^99;1;8' && head ../../4/input/measurements.txt | grep '^4;1;8'` - different between two files  
`docker rm $(docker ps -q --filter "status=exited")` remove all exited containers

## Changes from the origin

### Changes in Flexpart

1. File <par_mod.f90>

```
141 - integer,parameter :: nxmax=361,nymax=181,nuvzmax=138,nwzmax=138,nzmax=138
141 + integer,parameter :: nxmax=721,nymax=361,nuvzmax=138,nwzmax=138,nzmax=138 ! 0.5 degree 138 level

198 - integer,parameter :: maxreceptor=20 ! maximum number of receptor points
198 + integer,parameter :: maxreceptor=200

207 - integer,parameter :: maxpart=100000 ! Maximum number of particles
207 + integer,parameter :: maxpart=7500000

208 -  integer,parameter :: maxspec=1 ! Maximum number of chemical species per release
208 + integer,parameter :: maxspec=6
```

2. File <makefile> in line 75 added the following:

```
INCPATH1 = /usr/include
INCPATH2 = /usr/include
LIBPATH1 = /usr/lib
F90 = gfortran
```

## parallelizing using Message Passing Interface (MPI)

The model scales well up to using 256 processors, with a parallel efficiency greater than 75 % for up to 64 processes on multiple nodes in runs with very large numbers of particles. The deviation from 100 % efficiency is almost entirely due to the remaining nonparallelized parts of the code, suggesting large potential for further speedup. A new turbulence scheme for the convective boundary layer has been developed that considers the skewness in the vertical velocity distribution (updrafts and downdrafts) and vertical gradients in air density. FLEXPART is the only model available considering both effects, making it highly accurate for small-scale applications, e.g., to quantify dispersion in the vicinity of a point source.

## Performance test

- Simulation direction – backward
- Species №18 or Ru-106
- Input IBDATE 20200418, IBTIME 000000, IEDATE 20200421, IETIME 130010 (other paramethers in [test](/flexpart_v10.4/test/) folder)
- Time does not include the time of downloading **grib_data** so calculation time would be increased

### Debugging

- [x] Change the user to root if you want to install/change something
- [ ] Use command `docker run -d -it --entrypoint="/bin/bash" -v "$PWD":/data/ -v /home/flexpart/series/:/series/ simflex:final` to connect to the container without calculations(for example test purpose)
- [ ] And then use `docker exec -it simflex /bin/bash` to connect to the running container

Command `docker inspect -f '{{.State.ExitCode}}' container_name`.
If the container after calculation has *ExitCode 0* then everything is ok, if *ExitCode 1* then something went wrong while calculation, container should be restarted, if *ExitCode 2* then something went wrong with user files and user should be informed about it.
